# pdf-to-txt

In some pdf's, the ctrl+f function might not be working due to various reasons. This obviously got many of us frustrated during the exam time. These few lines will help you to convert any pdf into text, so that all the ctrl+ functions can be performed with ease :)

## Environment
just enter "pip install pyPDF2" in your terminal to install the pyPDF module and don't forget to keep the PDF file in the same folder as this code. That's it.
